This is designed to run under windows or linux, and the ./build script should
do the right thing when invoked at a cygwin shell or linux/freebsd/etc shell

Sorry for the lack of a Makefile, it freaks MSVC out to have a unix Makefile.

To build the Windows executable, you need to have MS Visual Studio 6.0 installed
in "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio"

From cygwin environment, do ./build  or from this directory in cmd.exe do "build"

Please email me with any issues.
